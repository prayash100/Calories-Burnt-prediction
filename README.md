# Calories-Burnt-predictor
 It is a ML model which can predict how much calory got burnt by taking some basic inputs from user such as Gender , Age, Height,Weight,Duration of exercise,Heartbeat .
 Here i have used XGBRegressor for model creation and trained with the dataset with 15000 entries .
 This model was trained and tested well.
 For evaluation i have used Mean Absolute Error method and its MAE value was 1.48
